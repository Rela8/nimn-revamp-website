      "According to him, the initiative is aimed to create a synergy between the apex advertising regulatory agency and the marketing body which will facilitate cross pollination of ideas, improve membership management and integration as well as capacity development.",
      "We want to have a situation whereby if you are a member of the National Institute of Marketing of Nigeria, moving into the advertising space should be less stressful and seamless” he said",
