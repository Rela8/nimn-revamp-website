      "The National Institute of Marketing of Nigeria, NIMN, has held its first Disciplinary Tribunal meeting 11 months after its inauguration in 2021. The Disciplinary Tribunal was set up with the aim to build a strong and highly professional marketing institute founded on the pillars of law and order. The essence of the inaugural meeting was for the Tribunal to have interaction with the Assessor, while he gives direction, guidance and advice to the Tribunal members on the legal procedures required in the discharge of their duty as the disciplinary panel set up by the institute. The meeting was held at the Institute’s Secretariat, at Adekunle Fajuyi Way, Ikeja, GRA.",
      "Attendees present at the Disciplinary Tribunal meeting include: Mr. Sidney Ogodo, Registrar, NIMN; Dr. Ify Uriah, Chairman of the Tribunal; Mrs. Evelyn Nwosu, Member of the Tribunal; Mr. Chidi Nwankpa, member; Prof. Michael Ikupolati, member; Mr. Debo Adebayo, member; Barrister Augustin Kalu, Assessor.",
      "Speaking with MARKETING EDGE in an interview, the Registrar of the historic institute, Sidney Ogodo, said the Tribunal could not act on their responsibility for the past 11 months due to the systemic process required in nominating and appointing the Assessor. Mr. Ogodo revealed that the Assessor was appointed by the Council on the nomination of the Attorney-general of the Federation.",
      "The National Institute of Marketing of Nigeria Disciplinary Tribunal and the constitutional of the tribunal requires that there should be an Assessor, that will give legal advice to the tribunal, the essence of the inaugural meeting is for members of the tribunal   to listen to the Assessor on the procedures of how they are going to work, for them to understand how to go about their responsibility as members of the tribunal, the legal perspective on how they will discharge their duty",
      "The Registrar noted that the tribunal panel has not recorded any misdemeanor about any member of the institute. He explained that it would have been impossible for the panel to act on the matter without the presence of the Assessor.",
      "The essence of the Assessor is to ensure full transparency in the whole process; he provides legal advice to both the tribunal and even to the respondent, so that at the end of the day, all parties will believe that there was a fair hearing. If there were pending cases, there was no way the tribunal could have handled it except there was an Assessor, so there is a procedure.",
      "For the chairman of the Disciplinary Tribunal, Dr. Ify Uriah, who was elated for the approval and appointment of the Assessor, which he said has brought some respite and a push for the panel to kick start with its disciplinary tribunal responsibility, once the Investigating panel gives them the signal to act on any case. The Disciplinary Tribunal Chairman also narrated some of the reasons why there was a hiatus from 7th May 2021 till now while stating the roles of the Assessor.",

      "The Institute has to write to the Federal Ministry of Justices that is the Attorney General of the Federation and minister of justices to nominate an assessor. It was 1st April that the Council met and appointed the Assessor and a formal letter was sent to him. We needed him to be in our meeting to give us guidelines, after today’s meeting, it will become a continuous process. He is here to guide and direct the tribunal by ensuring that they carry out their duty according to the law and NIMN Act. Now that we have an Assessor, any issue brought before the tribunal can now be looked into.",
      "The Assessor, Barrister Augustin Kalu, Assistant Director, Federal Ministry of Justices, reiterated his commitment in ensuring that the rule of law is strictly adhered and fairness given to all involved.",
      "My role as an Assessor is like that of a Quasi- Power. My role as an Assessor will be to guide the tribunal in terms of law, advise them on the procedure, observance of the fair hearing as enshrined in our constitution and also in the Act establishing NIMN and other legal matters that they may need.  I will also assist the tribunal to ensure that all known legal rules are observed. We  will be handling issues of disciplinary matters , in other words, those marketers who will be found wanting in their performances and  in the discharge of their functions will be brought to the tribunal to see if those people are really fit and proper to continue practicing marketing.",

    paragraphs: [
      "As part of strategies aimed at re-addressing its knotty issue of dormant membership, the governing council of the National Institute of Marketing of Nigeria (NIMN) has announced plans to avail members, whose membership status had been dormant over the years, the opportunity of a 90-day period to regularize their financial status with the marketing institute.",
      "The Institute also announced the election of Professor Michael Kupolati and Mrs Ebisan Onyema, as its First and Second Vice Presidents, respectively.",

      "Making the announcements at the institute’s Annual General Meeting (AGM), held in Lagos over the weekend, its President and Chairman of Council, Mr Idorenyen Enang described the measure as one of the strategic interventions of the council, aimed at driving sustainability from the second half of the Year 2022, and enhancing the institute’s membership base.",

      "According to him, the ‘debt forgiveness’ scheme provides members, who had not been financially active in the past years, the opportunity to only pay up the 2021 and 2022 Annual dues, with the institute writing off other debts such members must have accumulated over the years.",
      "He, however, added that any member, passing through the debt forgiveness window, expected to run between July 1 and September 30, 2022, would, however, go through the institute’s reintegration process, before being allowed back as full members.",

      "While charging debtor-members on the need to avail themselves of the opportunity, the NIMN boss argued that failure to utilise such an opportunity would mean throwing off a lifetime opportunity that would allow such debtor-members the opportunity to seamlessly regularize their membership, with the institute.",

      "He further stated that some of the focal areas of the council in the second half of the year, are to resuscitate the institute’s in-house journal, and review the curriculum of its professional examination, while also restructuring its chapter operations for enhanced and meaningful membership engagement.",

      "The NIMN’s boss expressed delight at the increasing interest the institute had continued to generate among members and the general public, in recent times, while assuring members of the council’s commitment to providing value and more benefits for members.",
      "He argued that one of the ways the council intends to achieve this is through strategic collaborations with sister professional bodies, such as the Advertisers Association of Nigeria (ADVAN), the Advertising Agencies Association of Nigeria (AAAN), the Outdoor Advertising Association of Nigeria (OAAN), the Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria (APBN), and even the industry’s apex regulatory body, the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON), and a host of other professional bodies.",

      "It was in this light that the Institute signed an MoU with the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) in January 2022, with the operational guideline for the MoU still being worked on",
      "Congratulating the newly-elected First and Second Vice Presidents, Enang stated with the successful conduct of the election, the elected officers would automatically replace the duo of Dr Kasuwar Gambo and Mr Chuka Eborah, the erstwhile first and second vice presidents, respectively, who had served out their terms on the institute’s council.",
      "Responding on behalf of the new officers, Professor Kupolati assured of their commitment to contributing their own quota to the development of the marketing institute.",

    paragraphs: [
      "Newly-elected President and Chairman of Council, National Institute of Marketing of Nigeria (NIMN), Mr. Idorenyen Enang, has pledged to improve collaboration between the institute and marketing professionals in the nation’s academia, so as to further reposition and enhance the quality of marketing practitioners in the country.",

      "Enang made the call even as experts have suggested that there were huge opportunities for businesses which have suffered adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic to turn around their fortunes with the support of marketing practitioners.",
      "Speaking in Lagos weekend after being sworn in as the Institute’s new president and chairman of council, he explained that one of the priorities of his administration would be to fully engage marketing professionals in the academia and ensure they contribute more to the capacity development programme of the institute.",

      "While commending his predecessor, Mr. Tony Agenmonmen, on his efforts at repositioning the marketing institute, the new NIMN boss assured members of his commitment to continue where his predecessor stopped, while also vigorously ensuring that his pre-election promises were fulfilled.",
      "Enang polled 306 votes to defeat his opponent, Mrs. Ifeoma Sheila Emasiana-Dike, who polled 36 votes. Mr. Chidi Nwamkpa and Dr. Peter Oriawote were also elected for the position of the two council seats",
      "According to the new NIMN boss, the support of every member, especially those in the academia had become imperative, if the institute is to take its pride of place among professional institutes in the country.",
      "Congratulating the new president on his victory at the polls, the former president of the Institute, Agenmonmen, expressed his confidence in the new president’s ability to steer the ship of the marketing institute to a safe berth.",

      "According to him, his administration had, in the past four years, been able to offset a substantial part of the N80 million debt it met, it was sworn in about four years ago.",

      "He added that one of the achievements of his administration was to quickly address the waning equity of the institute, on assumption of office, adding that in the last four and a half years, his administration succeeded in repositioning the institute and re-established its waning brand.",
      "Agenmonmen also expressed the delight that despite the torturous journey towards getting the Institute’s proclamation done by the supervising minister, as stipulated by the Act setting up the institute, his administration was able to get that done on 17th February, 2017, when the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Okechukwu Enelamah, made the proclamation at his investiture.",
      "He also stated that one of the legacies his administration would be leaving behind was the digitization of the Institute’s operating systems, an action, he noted, that mitigated the vagaries of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Institute’s operations.",
      "The former president of the marketing institute stated that with the digitization of the Institute’s operations, it was able able to carry out an electronic voting that allowed more members to participate at deciding the choice of the Institute’s leadership, irrespective of their places of residents.",
      "One of the highlights of the two-day event was the conferment of the institute’s Fellowship Awards on 26 members of the institute, and an Honorary Fellowship to the Group Executive, Retail Banking Group, South, First Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Nnaemeka Ejeh.",

      "Earlier, at its Annual Marketing Conference tagged ‘SMEs in Post Covid-19 World’, Agenmonmen had argued that every professional, especially marketers, had a role to play, in the post Covid-19 world, if the nation’s small businesses were to survive. According to him, the decision to have the theme of this year’s marketing conference focus on MSMEs, their roles in an economy, the clear and present danger which the COVID-19 pandemic had constituted to their survival, and what marketing practitioners could do to ensure their survival, was to bring this all-important issue to the front-burner.NIMN has made very conscious efforts to deepen the discussions around some topics that are germane to our growth and development as a nation, he stated. In his keynote address, the Guest Speaker, Mr. Alex Okoh, argued that though MSMEs are critical stimulators of economic growth, due to their potential to create jobs, he was, however, of the strong belief that inadequate access to the market, infrastructure challenges and other extraneous factors had all contributed to slow down their growth, and spike production cost.",

      "While arguing that COVID-19 had affected small businesses and redefined individual and corporate ways of doing things, Okoh, who is also the Director General, Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), believed there were huge opportunities for those businesses to turn around their fortunes, especially with the support of marketing practitioners.For instance, he argued, marketing practitioners should be ready to support small businesses in the area of market orientation, which, he noted, is presently low. Every business needs publicity. Marketing allows the business to connect with the consumers. It boosts sales, helps the business to construct constant clientele base. That is why I believe it can play a major role in MSMEs’ survival in the country, he added.",

      "In her submission, the founder and Chief Responsibility Officer of Ruff ‘N’ Tumble, Mrs. Adenike Ogunlesi, stressed the need for business owners to be attuned to the essence of marketing to enable them leverage it for their businesses’ growth, She also believed every business owner must understand the shift in the modern-day consumer’ behaviour, and must therefore design their products with such shifts in mind.",
